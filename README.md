# chess_first_move_advantage
In the game of chess, the player using the white piece gets to play the first move. Traditionally, it is believed
that this gives the player playing white an advantage. This idea has been backed up using chess engine
analysis which are based on complicated computer algorithms and systems that evaluate positions. From
the starting position, white is given an advantage of around points, which is equivalent to white having 0.5
more pawns than black. While not a massive advantage, this can strongly influence play at the highest level.
Therefore, top-level players with the white pieces generally go for the win, while players with the black pieces
often play for a draw. However, if a player with black attempts to go for the win, it is believed that they
have to make a riskier (riskier in the sense that they could lose easily) opening choice than a player with
white.
In this analysis, I wanted to test the validity of these beliefs and try to answer if white truly has an advantage
over black in the game of chess? Does whiteâ€™s privilege to move first contribute to it having more openings
and options to win games without taking as many risks as black? I hypothesize that these ideas are true
due to the high-stakes nature of competitive chess.
